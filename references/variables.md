# Variables Affecting Sheep Milk Production (Summary)

**Main Factors:**
1. **Temporal**
   - **Date/Month of Birth:** Higher production in spring vs. autumn (up to +17%).
   - **Milking Days:** Maximum production 3-4 weeks postpartum; intervals >24h reduce output.

2. **Environmental**
   - **Temperature:** >25°C reduces production by up to 20%.
   - **TH Index (ITH):** ITH >72 decreases production (up to -30% if ITH >80).
   - **Solar Radiation:** High radiation reduces production; shade improves performance (+10-15%).
   - **Precipitation:** Optimal 40-60 mm/month for forage and production.

3. **Management**
   - **Pen Space:** 1.5-2 m²/sheeep improves production (+5-10%).
   - **Location:** Ventilated pens and access to pastures optimize results.
   - **Milking Frequency:** Morning milking produces 10-15% more than evening milking.

4. **Biological**
   - **Breed:** Differences in thermal stress thresholds and lactation patterns.
   - **Live Weight:** Directly related to productive capacity.

5. **Other**
   - **Lunar Calendar:** Minor variations (<4%) associated with lunar phases (not conclusive).
