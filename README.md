## üìÇ Project Structure

This project is organized into the following main directories and files. As the project progresses, additional files and directories will be added:

1. **data/**: This folder will eventually contain all data-related files.

2. **notebooks/**: This folder will contain Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis, experimentation, and model training.

3. **models/**: Once models are trained, this directory will store final models.
   
4. **docs/**: This folder will eventually include all documentation related to the project.

5. **test/**: This directory will contain unit test scripts and test data to ensure that the project code works as expected and that the models are functioning correctly.

6. **references/**: This folder will store articles, studies, and other resources that provide background and context for the project.

7. **src/**: This folder will contain the core source code, divided into modular scripts for different tasks.

8. **requirements.txt**: This file will list all the Python dependencies required for the project, allowing others to easily install them by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
